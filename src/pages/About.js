          I'm a young up start programmer making websites and perfecting my
          craft. Starting since i was a young child i always would fiddle and
          deconstruct computers. When I was a little older I started fixing them
          but also learning about the software on it as well. Fast forward until
          high school and was making website and writing code better than anyone
          I knew! As of now my goal is to perfect my craft while providing
          perfect service. In the future I dream of starting my own business and
          helping the youth of tomorrow do what I do know!
